# Nabto Edge Client SDK Core Libs for iOS

The .a file provided here is for manual installation of the core libraries.

For simpler installation, use the [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) package manager. Add the following to your `Podfile`:

```
  pod 'NabtoEdgeClientApi'
```

For a high level wrapper, see https://github.com/nabto/edge-client-swift (not distributed through Cocoapods yet).
