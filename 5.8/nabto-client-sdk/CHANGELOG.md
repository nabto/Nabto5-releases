### Breaking Changes

#### MDNS subtype connectioms

Before 5.2 the default mdns connection behavior was to scan for all
devices and search the the device in the list of all the
devices. After 5.2 including 5.2 the default behavior is to use the
mdns subtype of the device when creating a local connection.  To use
local connections with devices which is older than 5.2 the option
ScanLocalConnect needs to be set.

#### Local UDP Ping when using direct candidates.

After 5.2 including 5.2 the clients is doing a local udp ping before a
direct candidate connection is made. Devices which is older than 5.2
does not support local ping and hence does not work with direct
candidates.
